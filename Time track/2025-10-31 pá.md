 - I woke up at 6:06. I had a good night, slept, or woke up only once during night. I did six minutes of Qigong, two minutes of warm-up, two minutes of sun salutation, so ten minutes of exercise. I feel quite fine. I spent like six hours and 30 minutes in bed. 
 - Now it is 6:40, 6:37, and I'm starting MBSR and time tracking.
