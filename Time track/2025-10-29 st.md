And so I'm waking up in much better shape and mood than yesterday and weeks before. We had a nice dinner with my wife. Physically I am not okay, but mentally this is much better. I slept almost seven hours in bed. Six hours, fifty-five minutes. And... I'm trying to reframe what I'm doing as help support. How I can support, how I can help people. How I can bring something better to the universe. Which is that spiritual reframing which we discussed yesterday with my wife and it helps. 

- I did two minutes of warm up and four minutes of chi kung at 6:45. 
- So it's 700 and I started MBSR in time tracking. 
- At 7:05 I spent 20 minutes on playing with Obsidian, which is in one hand frustrating because I didn't solve what I wanted, in the other hand it's good that I'm just like flowing without push to do everything according to the structure. So fuck it for now, let's do something else. 
- So at 7:25 I'm starting again time tracking, I'm trying to clean the mess because in recent days I forgot to time track. The purpose of time tracking is that it helps me to stay balanced. So I spent thirty-five minutes on reviewing what's ready for the online publishing. 
- The key insight is that when I am having more leisure time, like walking outside and so on, it helps me to decompress. I feel better, I feel more satisfied then. An interesting experiment would be to introduce walks, just to walk in nature for ten minutes or so. 
- At 9:20 I took 20 minutes of online content project communication. 
- Then at 10 o'clock I took 20 minutes of relaxation. 
- Then at 11:45 we took 30 minutes of learning with my son. It went well. 
- Now at 12:45 I took business overhead office arrangements. I'm at home but I cleaned my office. 
- And now it is 13:10 and I'm starting business overhead online communication. I spent 90 minutes on it and 
- at 14:40 I took 20 minutes of relaxation. 
- Perfect, at 15:07 I took 13 minutes to play with Obsidian app and I solved it. 
- At 15:20 I started to play with finance and I succeeded to connect the wallet app. I played with it 80 minutes, good results, I'm happy. 
- Now it is 16:40 and I'm going to review the AI testing. Spent 40 min on it - cool 👍 
- 

I'm going to bed in a good mood, feeling quite fine. Not sure why exactly. I'm trying to be in that servant attitude, to bring good, to support, to help.
