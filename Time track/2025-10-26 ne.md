So I slept longer today, seven and a half hours. The time has changed from summer to winter at night and I'm feeling quite okay. Although I woke up two times at night.

In the morning I worked like 20 minutes just on tasks review and organization. Then I spent at 8 o'clock I spent 60 minutes with Toník, helping him to learn how to handle the computer. 


- At 12:15 I spent 30 minutes with power nap. 🟩 
- At 13:05 I spent 15 minutes trying to handle issues with my screen.  🟨 
- At 13:25 I spent fifteen minutes playing with uTorrent so this is procrastination. 🟨 
- At 13:43 at last, hopefully I'm starting online content project. I spent two and a half hours on it, 150 minutes. It went well 
	- I did quite a few things. I stopped procrastinating on some configurations on my comp. Then I wrote letters to admins. I reposted two articles. I'm considering reposting other things. 
- I relaxed for 15 minutes at 16:15, it was fine. Then at 17:00 I started another 90 minutes of online content project content creation. And then 

Nice violation of discipline, I like it. We watched Mulan movie. The movie Mulan. I worked a lot during the day, they published my article. I feel fine, that's good.
